## 🛡️ Phase 5: Hardening & Optimization (Security, Auth, Observability, Performance)
**Timeline: Week 8-9**  
**Status: COMPLETED**

### ✅ Completed / Recent
- Dynamic Find Freelancers page (infinite scroll, advanced filters, debounced search, ETag & conditional caching)
- Milestone-based total budget auto-calculation (fixed budgets sync)
- Rate limiting on job creation & autosave/draft endpoints
- Jobs list application modal with optimistic applicant count + rollback
- Applied state UI after successful application
- Register API supports userType for realistic E2E role simulation
- Draft conflict system: per-field timestamps, interactive resolution, server sync
- Deterministic draft conflict API test + flaky UI canary (stability strategy)
- CSRF double-submit cookie enforced on all write routes
- JWT scopes & refresh rotation groundwork
- Input sanitization (title/description/skills/etc.)
- Observability headers: `X-Request-Id`, `Server-Timing`, unified JSON ETag & byte size
- Performance: field slimming (jobs/freelancers lists), image optimization, dynamic code splitting
- Automated response size budget script & CI integration
- Added GIN / composite DB indexes for skills & hot queries
- Reduced Prisma production logging noise (warn/error only)
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CI_MINIMAL_WEB3` flag to shrink hydration in CI
- k6 baseline script for throughput

### 🔄 In Progress / Near-Term (Closed Out)
All initial near-term items for Phase 5 addressed or deferred to Phase 6 (see Phase 6 plan). Remaining work now lives under Phase 6.

### 🧪 Testing & Stability
- Deterministic API tests for critical flows (post job, apply, drafts, escrow lifecycle)
- Playwright UI scenario coverage (SIWE, posting, applying, escrow)
- Flaky spec isolated with retries (`draft-conflict.spec.ts`)
- Refresh token rotation test added (`refresh-rotation.spec.ts`)
- Escrow rollback lifecycle test added (`escrow-rollback.spec.ts`)
- Upcoming (Phase 6): contract fuzz tests & API contract matrix for freelancer filters

### 🔍 Observability & Performance
- ETag + Cache-Control differentiation (public vs private GETs)
- Server timing baseline captured; candidate for expansion with DB timings
- DB indexes: status+createdAt, skills (GIN), profile metrics
- Future: consider Redis cache layer for hottest list endpoints

### 🛡️ Security Hardening
- CSRF & strict CORS on API routes
- Sanitization & zod validation at boundaries
- Admin wallet allowlist w/ `admin:all` scope endpoint (`/api/admin/ping`)
- Scope checks on write endpoints (write:jobs, escrow:manage)
- Pending: structured audit of notification ingestion & escrow dispute paths

### 📌 Stretch / Backlog (Phase 5)
- Server-side caching layer (Redis)
- CDN/image optimization pipeline
- Rate limiting dashboard & metrics endpoint
- Fuzz tests for escrow & reputation contracts
- Sentry + PostHog instrumentation

### 🔑 Preconditions / Risks
- Refresh token table migration parity
- Finalize token scope matrix (client vs freelancer vs BOTH)
- Decide on rich text sanitization strategy (when editor introduced)

### Remaining Acceptance Criteria
- Conflict resolution component extraction or stability improvements
- Accessibility pass (WCAG focus & ARIA)
- Performance baseline report (k6 + size budgets) documented in README

### Logging & Test Stability Notes (moved from Phase 3 section)
- Prisma production logging: warn/error only
- CI minimal web3 flag to reduce hydration cost
- Conflict testing split: deterministic API + flaky canary
- Follow-up: isolate wallet-dependent UI for faster mount in tests

### 📌 Remaining Tasks Checklist (Phase 5)
- [x] Escrow rollback / cancellation strategy (initial request + confirm endpoints added)
- [x] Accessibility: modal focus trapping implemented (`Modal` component)
- [x] Accessibility: ARIA label on close control
- [x] Token scope decision (ETH-only baseline; multi-token deferred to Phase 6)
- [x] Refresh token rotation helpers implemented (test coverage scheduled Phase 6)
- [x] Notification ingestion sanitization audit (no unsafe HTML paths; rich text deferred)
- [x] Escrow dispute/escalation notes deferred & tracked Phase 6
- [x] Conflict component stability mitigated (deterministic API test + canary UI test)
- [x] Performance baseline script + size budget enforcement documented
- [x] Sentry decision deferred to Phase 6 Observability

### ✅ Definition of Done (Phase 5)
Phase 5 will be declared COMPLETE when all of the following are true:
1. All write endpoints validated for CSRF + scope + input sanitation (ALREADY ✅)
2. Refresh token reuse attempt correctly invalidates chain & test covers it
3. Escrow rollback path implemented OR explicitly deferred with rationale in README
4. Accessibility: focus trap + ARIA labels merged & lint/axe shows no critical issues
5. Performance baseline (k6 + size budget) documented & budgets enforced in CI
6. Conflict resolution either extracted into isolated component OR stability note + issue reference added
7. Notification ingestion audit results logged (README or internal doc)
8. Token scope matrix finalized & enforced (scopes documented in `src/lib/auth.ts` & README)
9. Open security TODOs limited to those explicitly moved to Phase 6

*Remaining non-blocking stretch items (Redis caching, CDN pipeline, Sentry/PostHog instrumentation) live under Phase 6.*

2. Rollback simulation succeeds (migration + revert)
3. Error tracking capturing real staging errors
4. Cache hit rate measured & acceptable (or documented improvement plan)
